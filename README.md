Car Class Implementation Challenge
My name is Scott Fennell (U86364709) and I am student at USF in the ISM 3232-521 course. 
This coding challenge is called the "Car Class Implementation Challenge".
The purpose of this project is to to track the speed of two makes of vehicles. The start at different speeds in accelerates while logging its current speed and also logging the speed when the vehicles are braking.
